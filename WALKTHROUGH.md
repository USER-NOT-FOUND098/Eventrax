# 🎬 The EventRAX Experience: A Grand Tour

Welcome to **EventRAX**! You've successfully installed the app and connected the database. But EventRAX isn't just a basic registration form—it is a massive, highly complex Event Management Engine built to handle real-world university fests.

Because the database comes to you 100% clean and empty, you might not immediately see all the hidden features. 

This short, enjoyable guide will take you on a **5-Step Master Tour** so you can experience everything this platform can actually do!

---

## 🎟️ Step 1: The Inciting Incident (Create an Event)
Let's bring this empty database to life.

1. **Log in** with the default Admin account (`admin@eventrax.com` / `admin123`).
2. **Log out** immediately, and click **Sign Up**.
3. Create a new account named **"Event Boss"**, select the **Event Creator** role, and register.
4. **The Catch:** You can't log in yet! EventRAX has strict security. Log back into the **Admin account**, go to the `Users` dashboard, and click the green checkmark (✔) to **Approve** your new Event Boss account.
5. Now, log in as the **Event Boss**.
6. Go to the **Events** dashboard and create your first massive festival! (Give it a budget of $10,000 to play with later).

## 🎪 Step 2: The Splinter Strategy (Sub-Events)
A massive festival (like "Tech Summit") isn't just one room. It has opening ceremonies, coding hackathons, and food stalls. We call these **Sub-Events**.

1. As the **Event Boss**, click on your newly created Event.
2. Inside the event, click the **Sub-Events** tab and create *"The Grand Opening Ceremony"*.
3. **The Magic:** EventRAX automatically segments budgets, chats, and volunteers based on these sub-events!

---

## 👑 Step 3: Delegating Power (Team Leads)
The Event Boss can't run the Opening Ceremony alone. They need a Team Lead.

1. Log out, and **Sign Up** a new account named **"Lead Coordinator"**, selecting the **Team Lead** role.
2. Remember, the **Admin** must approve them first!
3. Log back in as the **Event Boss**, go to your Opening Ceremony *Sub-Event*, and assign your "Lead Coordinator" to be the Team Lead of that specific room.
4. You have just successfully delegated full control of a sub-event to another user!

---

## 🎒 Step 4: The Army Arrives (Students & Volunteers)
Now we need the student body.

1. **Sign Up** yet another account, this time as a **Student** (e.g., `student@eventrax.com`). *(Students do not require Admin approval to join!)*
2. As the Student, you will see a beautiful dashboard populated with the Event Boss's festival. Click on it.
3. The Student can now **Register** for the event AND apply to be a **Volunteer** for the Opening Ceremony!
4. **The Workflow:** Log in as the **Team Lead**. You will see the student's volunteer application. Approve it!

---

## 💬 Step 5: The War Room (Real-Time Chat & Budgets)

This is where the app truly shines. The Opening Ceremony is about to start.

### The Live Chat 💬
Log in as the **Student** (who is now an approved volunteer) and navigate to the Sub-Event. You will see a **Live Chat** window. Type a message. 
If you log in as the **Team Lead**, you will see that message in real-time. This is how teams coordinate during the chaos of the event!

### Budget & Expenses 💰
Log in as the **Event Boss**. Go to the event's **Budget** tab. 
Add an expense (e.g., "Bought 100 Chairs for Opening Ceremony: $500").
Watch the dashboard's circular progress bars instantly calculate your remaining funds and categorize your spending beautifully.

### The Glory (Prizes & Certificates) 🏆
The event is over. The Student worked hard. 
As the **Event Boss**, go to the Event dashboard, find the **Prizes** tab, and generate a beautiful **Winner's Certificate** for the Student. 

---

### 🎉 You Did It!
If you completed this tour, you have just experienced:
- **RBAC:** (Role-Based Access Control) across 4 different permission levels.
- **Relational Data Mapping:** Events -> Sub-Events -> Tasks -> Volunteers.
- **Live State Management:** Real-time chat polling and notification drops.
- **Financial Logic:** Categorized expense and budget tracking.

You have unlocked the full power of EventRAX. Enjoy coding and expanding this massive open-source project!
